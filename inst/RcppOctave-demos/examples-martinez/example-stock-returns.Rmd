This example doesn't work because of problem with statistics package

```{r}
library(RcppOctave)
.CallOctave("version")
```

```{r}
f_stocks <- OctaveFunction("
function [x] = stocks() 
  pkg load statistics
  load stockreturns
  % Loads up a variable called stocks.
  % Perform factor analysis:3 factors,default rotation.
  [LamVrot,PsiVrot] = factoran(stocks,3);
  x = 1;

end
                           ")
```


```{r}
stocks <- f_stocks()
```
